//What is a stack data structure..?
/* 
    Stack is a linear data structure (i.e) Data is stored in an adjacent (or) nearby position, which follows LIFO (or) FILO
    LIFO - Last in first out
    FILO - First in last out
    Ex: 
    * A pile of books
    * A stack of coins
    * It is just a logical entity
    * Stack is an abstract data type with an predefined capacity
    * 
*/

//Working of an stack..?
/*
   * In a stack if an element is added to it is stored in the bottom of the stack
   * In a stack if an element is removed the top element gets removed first 
In simple words:
  * An element is always added (or) removed  to the bottom/from the top respectively  
  
*/

/*
  Standard stack operations:
     *push(): Adds an element to the bottom of the stack
     *pop():  Removes an element from the top of the stack
     *isfull(): Tell us if the stack is Full or not
     *isempty(): Tells us if the stack is Empty or not
     *peek(i): It can be used to access the element on the index[i]
     *count(): It returns the total no of elements in the stack
     *Display(): It displays all the elements in the stack
     *change(i): Changes the element at the i position

/*
APPLICATION OF STACK:
     * 1.) Undo or redo functionally
            Ex:
            Whenever a " { " is used to open a function a " } " is used along with it to close the funtion
            This makes the net value in the stack as always equals to zero
        2.) cache memory:
               *Similarities: While cache memory and stack are distinct concepts, they do share some similarities:
                Temporal Locality: Both cache memory and stack take advantage of temporal locality, which means that recently 
                accessed data is likely to be accessed again in the near future.

     *- There are more to be added

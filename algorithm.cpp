// Algorithms are specific set of instruction that are followed by a computer in 
//specific order to perform specific tasks
//There are some characteristics to an algorithm
/*
1.) They have 0 or more than 0 inputs
2.) They have 1 or more than 1 outputs
3.) Unambiguity- Clear and simple instructions
4.) Effectiveness-Each and every line in an algorithm has a great effect in an overall program
5.) Finiteness- Codes are limited and short

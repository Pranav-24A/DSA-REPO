//There are two ways of looking at a data structures
/* 1)mathematical/logical/abstract view 
   2)implementation*/

//What are abstract data types ..?
// Abstract data type are which has a data structure and a function but not an implementation
// (i.e)..We only know that the data is stored and all the functions it can perform but we do no
// how the data is stored and it cannot be implemented because 
// diffrent programming languages has a diffrent type of implementation
            //in simple words a user only knows what a datatype can do :understand that we are not the users mentioned , the one 
            //who uses our code as product is known as a user
//and doesn't know how it can be implemented for storing
/*For ex:
    in python the userdefined functions can be explained using def
    whereas in c++ they are defined along with the datatype*/
    //Another best example  is mobile phones:
    //abstract view (or) user's view        implementation view (or) programmer's view
    //256 GB ROM                             // int ROM;
    //8 GB RAM                               //int RAM;
    //120mp camera                           //int mp;
    //voicecall()                            //void voicecall()
    //videocall()                            //void videocall()
    //camera()                               //void camera()
/* As you can see in the above lines a user only knows that a mobile phone can make calls and 
doesn't know how it is implented to make call :This is the meaning of abstract (i.e) Showing only the essentials and hiding the 
unwanted*/
